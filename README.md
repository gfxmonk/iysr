# iysr - a simple service monitor for `systemd`

_is your stuff running?_

`iysr` (pronounced "eyes-a", or "visor" without the "v") is a service monitoring tool built
with `systemd` in mind. Out of the box it knows how enumerate services, watch for
service state changes and follow journal logs.

# iysr is _alpha software_

Right now it is functional, but far from complete. It may change a lot. It's not very
configurable, nor well documented.
